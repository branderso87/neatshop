#Neatshopp | A Gateway to Neat Things

Neatshopp is an ecommerce store selling neat things at a great price.

The app pulls and displays product listings from ebay stores and will very soon include purchase capabilities and filtering.

The site is currently in development and is slated for release before the end of the year.

##Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

###Installing

In order to run you'll need to clone this repo and install the package.json file. I like to use yarn but you can also use npm as well.

yarn:
```
yarn add
yarn start

```
npm:
```
npm install
npm start
```
